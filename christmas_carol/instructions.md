Working in Python. I have a string that has single \n and double and triple \n. For example
"Mark Lattimore\nwas here\n\n.Yes, really he was.\n\n\n. I want to programatically delete all single \n instances without affecting the multiple \n instances.

You can use Python's re module to solve this problem. The strategy is to match and replace only the single \n instances while leaving multiple consecutive \n intact. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
import re

# Input string
text = "Mark Lattimore\nwas here\n\n.Yes, really he was.\n\n\n"

# Replace single '\n' instances with a space
result = re.sub(r'(?<!\n)\n(?!\n)', ' ', text)

print(result)
Explanation of the Regular Expression:
(?<!\n) ensures that the \n being matched is not preceded by another \n (negative lookbehind).
\n matches a newline character.
(?!\n) ensures that the \n being matched is not followed by another \n (negative lookahead).
Output:
css
Copy code
Mark Lattimore was here

.Yes, really he was.


This effectively removes single \n while keeping the double or triple \n untouched.

Now. I want to replace the \n\n instances with html tags. Beginning at the start of the string, I want to insert a <p> index 0. Then, at every occurrence of multiple \n, replace with </p>,<p>. Finally insert a </p> at the end of the string.

Here's how you can achieve this using Python. We'll handle the replacements step by step, ensuring we maintain proper HTML structure.

Code:
python
Copy code
import re

# Input string
text = "Mark Lattimore\nwas here\n\n.Yes, really he was.\n\n\n"

# Replace multiple \n with </p><p>
html_text = re.sub(r'\n{2,}', '</p><p>', text.strip())

# Add <p> at the start and </p> at the end
html_text = f"<p>{html_text}</p>"

print(html_text)
Explanation:
Remove excess whitespace at the start and end of the string: Use text.strip() to ensure no stray newlines affect our tags.
Replace multiple \n with </p><p>:
The regex \n{2,} matches two or more consecutive newline characters.
Replace them with the HTML tags </p><p>.
Wrap the entire string in <p> and </p>:
Add <p> at the beginning and </p> at the end.
Output:
html
Copy code
<p>Mark Lattimore
was here</p><p>.Yes, really he was.</p><p></p>
Notes:
If you want to remove extra empty <p></p> tags created by trailing or excessive \n, you can further clean the result using another regex:
python
Copy code
html_text = re.sub(r'<p></p>', '', html_text)
Adjust spacing or formatting as needed based on your specific requirements for the output
